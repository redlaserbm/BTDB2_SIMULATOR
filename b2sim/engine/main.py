        Essentially, the code works like this:
        Look at the first send in the queue and decide if the time to use the send is too early or late, or if there is otherwise no circumstance under which the send will be used during simulation.
        - If it's too late (we are beyond the last round which we would use the send), remove the send from the queue
        - If it's too early, adjust the time to earliest available time we can use the send
        
        If the process above results in the first send in the queue being slated to be used after the second, *remove* the first send.
        The process above repeats until either the queue is empty or the first send in the queue is valid.

        Once it is determined that the first send in the queue is valid, check for and remove any properties from the eco which cannot be applied to said send.

        When the process above is complete, we must check whether we should change to first send in the queue right now or not.
        - If the answer is no, we can exit the process.
        - If the answer is yes, switch to said send, and then rerun the queue correction process so that the *new* first eco send in the queue is valid (if necessary).
